##  MERN STACK :
MERN stack is the name given to a set of JavaScript based technologies used in developing **“web application”** . MERN stack is the acronym name given to the set of technologies including **MongoDB, Express JS, React JS/ Redux and Node JS**.

Among these technologies :-
**MongoDB** is a database system.
**Node JS** is a back-end runtime environment.
**Express JS** is a back-end web framework.
**React** is a front-end framework.

####Why its required :
A standard application stack makes it much easier and faster to bring in new developers and get them up to speed as there’s a good chance that they have used the technology elsewhere. For those new to these technologies, there exist some great resources to get you up and running.These technologies share a common aim - look after the critical but repetitive stuff in order to free up developers to work where they can really add value, building your killer app in record time.Rather than an application being an  isolated entity, it is very useful to interact with different types of service through public APIs.


####MongoDB :

MongoDB is a totally free and open source platform database available to all users.Classified as a **NoSQL** database program. Mongo DB uses JSON-like documents with schemata. Mongo DB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and is published under a combination of the GNU (General Public License and the Apache License).

####Express JS :

Express JS is also known as simply Express, is a **web application framework** for Node.js. Express is totally free and open source framework. It is used for building web applications and APIs.Express is the backend part of the MEAN stack with AngularJS frontend framework and MongoDB database.

####React or Redux :

React also known as React.js or React JS , is a JavaScript library used for building **user interfaces (UI)**. It is maintained by Facebook and other individual developers and companies.
React can be used as base in the development of **“single-page or mobile applications”**. Complex React applications requires additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API.

Redux is an open source JavaScript library and it is use for **managing application state**. Redux is  most commonly used with different libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces.


####Node JS :

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript **run-time environment** that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.before,JavaScript was used primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript are written in a webpage’s HTML and run client side machine by a JavaScript engine or interpreter in the user’s web browser.

Node.js now developers are using JavaScript to write “Command Line Tools” and for **“server-side scripts”** to produce ***dynamic web page content*** ” before the page is sent to the user’s web browser.Most important thing is that **“JavaScript everywhere”** ,Web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.
